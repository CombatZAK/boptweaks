BoPTweaks by CombatZAK

DESCRIPTION
This mod makes is possible to plant and grow Biomes O Plenty fir trees in their large '+' shaped trunk. Normally these tress are only created in Coniferous Forest biomes during world generation. To grow them, simply plant 5 fir saplings in a horizontal '+' pattern, and the middle sapling will grow into a big fir tree.

The mod also slightly modifies the growth behavior of "normal" fir trees. Now, a sapling that would grow into a small fir tree has a 1:10 chance to grow into a tall tree with a 1x1 trunk, also normally only created during world generation.

REQUIREMENTS:
This mod requires Biomes O Plenty to be installed - it is confirmed to work with Minecraft Forge 1.7.10 build 1614, and Biomes O Plenty for 1.7.10 version 2.1.0 build 2027. Other version of BOP and Forge may also work
